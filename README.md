## Sync

If you have enabled synchronization application will sync changes to your filesystem!

* Any cell change that has influence on filename of the book will cause its rename
* If you delete book in MyLibrary it will delete corresponding real file if sync is *ON* 
* You cannot remove records without corresponding real file if sync is *ON*
* You have to manage file extension manually to rename file properly.
* If you change book filename format it will not rename all books! It will apply new format only to newly renamed books


## Importing new books

To import books into the library you have to drop your books to library folder you've set in configuration and then on *Import* tab press "Import Books". 
It will import all books from file system that are not in database yet.
